1- TERMINAL FUNDAMENTALS


- What is the difference between / and ~? What do we call each of these directories?
/ is the root directory
~ is shorthand for home directory 

- What command do we use to change directories?
Cd: change directories

- What is the difference between an absolute and relative path?
Absolute path: specific path starting at the root directory(/)
Relative path: is relative to where you are at the moment.

WORKING WITH FILES & FOLDERS

Exercises
- Create a file called name.txt: touch name.txt

- Try renaming the file to rename.txt using the mv command. What does this tell you about the command?: mv name.txt rename.txt

- Using the cp command, make a copy of rename.txt and call it copy.txt: cp rename.txt copy.txt

- Remove the file copy.txt: rm copy.txt

- Create a folder called questions: mkdir questions

- Change directories to the questions folder: cd questions

- Create a file called first.txt: touch first.txt

- Create a file called second.txt: touch second.txt

- Go back a directory and make a copy of the questions folder and call it questions_copy.
When using cp -r what is the -r called? What does it do?: 
cd ..
cp -r questions questions_copy
r used for when coping a directory.  It will copy everything inside it. 


Delete the original questions folder and the copy.
rm -rf questions
rm -rf questions_copy

TERMINAL BASIC EXERCISES

PART I

- Make a directory called first: mkdir first

- Change directory to the first folder: cd first

- Create a file called person.txt: touch person.txt

- Change the name of person.txt to another.txt: mv person.txt another.txt

- Make a copy of the another.txt file and call it copy.txt: cp another.txt copy.txt

- Remove the copy.txt file: rm copy.txt

- Make a copy of the first folder and call it second: cp -r first second

- Delete the second folder: rm -rf second



PART II

- What does the man command do? Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out? Man lists the manual for a command. To scroll: advance 1/2 page (D), 1/2 page back(u), one page back(b)

- Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? What does the -a flag do? -l list files in a list format with more details, and -a list all files including hidden ones.

- Type the following command to download and save the contents of google.com: curl https://www.google.com > google.html

- Use less to look at the contents of google.html.

- Look at the man page for less. Read the section on /pattern. Search for the text hplogo in the google.html file.

- How do you jump between words in the terminal? Option + left or right arrow.

- How do you get to the end of a line in terminal? Control + e

- How do you move your cursor to the beginning in terminal? Control + a

- How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in terminal? Control + w

- What is the difference between a terminal and shell? Shell is the program that handles the commands, and the terminal is the interface to interact with the shell.

- What is an absolute path?Is a  path starting at the root directory(/) and gives the complete location of a file or directory.

- What is an relative path?is a path starting at the current location.

- What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used. A flag adds additional functionality to a command.  I had use -a,-l,-r,-rf

- What do the r and f flags do with the rm command? R will remove all folders, and f will force removal.


2- PERMISSIONS,REDIRECTION AND PIPING

PART I

- Create a file called restricted.txt: touch restricted.txt

- Change the permissions on the restricted.txt file to allow the owner to read and write to the restricted.txt file. Do this using the Octal Notation: chmod 600 restricted.txt 

- Change the permissions on the restricted.txt file to only allow the owner, group and everyone to read and write and execute the restricted.txt file. Do this using the Symbolic notation: chmod 777 restricted.txt

- Create a folder called secret_files. Inside the secret_files folder create a file called first_secret.txt and another folder called classified. Inside of the classified folder create a file called super_secret.txt.

 mkdir secret_files
 cd secret_files
 touch first_secret.txt
 mkdir classified
 cd classified
 touch super_secret.txt
	
- Change the permissions on the secret_files to only allow the owner and group to read, write and execute in all the files and folders inside of secret_files. Do this using the Octal Notation: chmod -R 770 secret_files 

- Create a hard link for the restricted.txt called hard_link: ln restricted.txt hard_link 

- Create a symbolic link for the classified folder called classified_link: ln -s secret_files/classified classified_link


PART II
Write the following terminal commands to do the following

-Sort vegetables.txt: sort vegetables.txt

- Count the number of lines in vegetables.txt: wc -l vegetables.txt 

-n Create a file called vegetables_sorted.txt which contains all the unique vegetables sorted in ascending order in vegetables.txt (do this without the touch command): cat vegetables.txt |sort | uniq > vegetables_sorted.txt

- Create a file called last_three.txt which contains the last three vegetables in the vegetables.txt file (do this without the touch command):cat vegetables.txt| tail -n 3 > last_three.txt

-Count the number of lines the word "Broccoli" appears on (using wc and grep):cat vegetables.txt | grep "Broccoli" | wc -l


3- ENVIRONMENT, PROCESS AND FINDING

Part I
Answer the following questions:

- Create an environment variable called FIRST_NAME and set it equal to your first name (this does not need to be permanent): export FIRST_NAME=Mary

- Print the FIRST_NAME variable: echo $FIRST_NAME

- Print out the $PATH variable: echo $PATH

- What is the $PATH variable? Set of paths for our environment to find where to run commands

- Why would you want to create an environment variable? 

- How do you permanently save environment variables? On the configuration file for shell(.zshrc or .bash_profile)

- What is a process? A computer program that is running.

- How do you list all processes running on your machine? ps aux

- What is a PID? Number unique to a process.

- How do you terminate a process? Kill or kill -9, and you use its PID.

- What is the difference between kill and kill -9? Kill -9 forces to stop the process(it won't be ignored) when kill is not working.

- What grep flag allows for case insensitive search? i. 

- What grep flag allows for a certain number of lines before the match? B

- What grep flag allows for a certain number of lines around the match? C 

- What grep flag allows for a certain number of lines after the match? A

- What grep flag allows for full word search? w

- What grep flag shows you the line number of a match? n

Part II
Write the following terminal commands to do the following (assume that instructors.txt is an imaginary file):

- Find all files inside the Desktop folder that have a name of "learn." : find ~/Desktop -name "learn"

- Find all files inside the Desktop folder that start with a "P.": find ~/Desktop -name "P.*"

- Find all files inside the Desktop folder that end with .txt.: find ~/Desktop -name "*.txt"

- Find all files inside the Desktop/views folder that have the name data somewhere in their filename: find ~/Desktop -name "*data*"

- Inside of the instructors.txt file, output the number of times the word "Elie" appears: grep -c "Elie" instructor.txt

- Inside of the instructors.txt file, list all matches for any full word that starts with a capital "P.": grep -w "P.*" instructor.txt

- Inside of the instructors.txt file, list all the line numbers for any full word that starts with a "z" (it should match regardless of upper or lower case): grep -ni "z.*" instructor.txt
